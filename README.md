This HTTP server will be made doing the RUST tutorial : Final Project: Building af Multithreaded Web Server. Where plan is the following:

1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
2. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
4. Create a proper HTTP response.
5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.
